Metric Converter Solo Project

Solo project for module 3 @ scrimba 

Used template literals [newly learned, so, it was fun]
Practice with pulling values etc. [newly learned so, was fun again] 

Very fun, and finished it faster than I had anticipated, so I am thrilled, to be honest. Refactors will occur as I figure other stuff out, and add to it all.
